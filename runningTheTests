You'll need the JsTestDriver.jar available here: http://code.google.com/p/js-test-driver/wiki/GettingStarted

To start the test server, on my box at least:
java -jar ~/jars/JsTestDriver.jar --port 4224

You'll then need to navigate one (or several) browsers to http://localhost:4224/

To run (all) the tests, after a browser has connected:
java -jar ~/jars/JsTestDriver.jar --tests all
